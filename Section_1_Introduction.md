<h1>Introduction</h1>

Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, which describes the force between two masses as 1)​ F = G(m_1*m_2/r^2)​, has long been a cornerstone of classical mechanics. However, modern physics demands a more comprehensive view that encompasses both gravitational forces and radiative energy within a single unified framework. This paper aims to extend Newton's equation into a broader energy-based model, where the relationship between mass, distance, and energy is redefined to include radiative components, utilizing the definitions from The Unifed Theory of Energy, most notably its Energy State Theorem:

“Energy exists in three distinct states: as Radiation, as Gravitation, and as Particulate Motion. Each of these three energy states cannot exist apart from, or without, the other states”
