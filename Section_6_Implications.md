<h1>6. Implications and Conclusions</h1>

This Unified Energy Framework offers new perspectives on the nature of cosmic phenomena. By treating Gravitation and Radiation as interdependent components of a single Energy Equation, we can better understand the dynamics of extreme events like Gamma Ray Bursts, Supernovae, and Black Holes. The impossibility of complete isolation of gravitation, radiation, or motion implies that these events exist within a continuum, with their characteristics varying according to Scale.

This model challenges traditional boundaries between distinct physical phenomena, proposing that all observed states are part of a unified energy spectrum. Future work will aim to refine this framework and explore its implications for other astrophysical and theoretical domains, potentially offering a pathway to a more cohesive understanding of the universe's fundamental forces.
