"Open Call for Collaboration – Unified Energy Equation

As the custodian of #TheoreticalPhysics on the internet, I invite collaboration on an article for a Unified Energy Equation, grounded in The Unified Theory of Energy. Starting with Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, it aims to redefine Energy across Scales.

Whether you’re curious or critical, your input is welcome. If no one responds, I’ll keep refining it solo."
