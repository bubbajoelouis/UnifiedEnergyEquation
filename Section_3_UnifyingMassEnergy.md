3. Unifying Mass and Energy

We further refine the Energy Equation to 3) E=G(M/𝑟^2), where M represents a combined Mass and 𝑟 the distance from the center of that mass to its surface, ensuring that 𝑟 cannot be zero in the divisor. This modification acknowledges the physical impossibility of a singularity at the core of massive objects, while still aligning with general relativity's treatment of black holes and other extreme gravitational environments.

This equation also suggests that the Mass is intrinsically connected to the spatial distribution of Energy surrounding it, integrating both Gravitation and Radiation. 

The distance 𝑟, interpreted as the extension of the mass's surface from its center, also serves as a variable describing the extent of radiative energy distribution, assuming the particles comprising the mass were stretched to their maximum possible distance from the center. 

In typical Mass Structures, however, 𝑟 is also understood as the maximum Surface Depth value, as defined by Definition 11 of The Unified Theory of Energy:

“Surface Depth is the depth of saturation of Radiation into a Mass Structure.”
