<h1>2. Transitioning from Force to Energy</h1>

The classical equation F=G(m_1*m_2/r^2)​​ describes the gravitational force between two masses m_1 and m_2​ separated by a distance r. 

By interpreting this force as a manifestation of Energy, I propose the transition to 2) ​​E=G(m_1*m_2/r^2).

Here, Energy is not simply a result of Gravitational interaction but a fundamental aspect of the system's state.
